WEB STACK DEBUGGING PROJECT
Web stack debugging is all about identifying and resolving errors and misconfiguration of certain
components that make  up a web application's infrastructure.

This project focuses on writing a bash script in which once executed, can bring a 
broken or bugged webstack into a working state.
